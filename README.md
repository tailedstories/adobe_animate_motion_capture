# adobe_animate_motion_capture
Use Mediapipe to recognise motion in the video and create animation in Adobe Animate (flash)

# Step 1

Download python environment. I use Anaconda and Spyder

# Step 2

Open the file video_to_joints.py

Find the variable called "cam_ref". Change it to a video name you like.

Save video in the same forlder as the python script.

If you see dependency error install missing rependencies with --> pip install mediapipe

Possibly other libraries.

# Step 3

Run the file midi_player_xml.py

It will create XML file for import to character animator

# Step 4
